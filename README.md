A simple Todo List using React Native and Expo. 

Main functionality:
-> Add Task
-> Delete task
-> When you complete a task, it gets added to the completed tasks in the bottom of the page


To be done later(just styling stuff)
- [ ]  Proper Header component which looks good
- [ ]  placeholder value for when no tasks are there
    - [ ]  styling that placeholder value that shows no tasks yet.
    - [ ]  icon above that placeholder value.
- [ ]  bar with counter of how many tasks are completed // still to do above tasks and below text box.
